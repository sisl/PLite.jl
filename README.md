# PLite.jl

PLite, pronounced "polite,"<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup> is a Julia-based modeling system for Markov decision processes. PLite turns Julia into a modeling language, allowing the stochastic problem to be specified using simple Julia expression syntax.

Installation can be done from the Julia console as follows.
```julia
julia> Pkg.clone("https://github.com/haoyio/PLite.jl")
```

Detailed documentation and examples for PLite.jl can be found [here](http://plitejl.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html). A .md version of the readme can also be found in the `docs` directory.
